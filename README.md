## Requirements
- Node
- Mongo

Start mongo. The app will use the server and DB declared in `server/config/environment`. Ensure that this DB contains a capped collection called `posts`, i.e., `db.posts.isCapped()` within the mongo shell to verify, or `db.createCollection( "posts", { capped: true, size: 1000000 } )` to create.


```
bower install
npm install
grunt serve
```
